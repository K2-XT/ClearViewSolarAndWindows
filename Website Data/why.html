			<h2>Solar Panel Efficiency Loss</h2>
			<hr>
			<div class="contenttext" style="width: 95%;">
				<p>When researching how much power is lost due to dirty solar panels, one can quickly become overwhelmed with rivaling sources and information claiming different amounts of efficiency output.<br></p>
				<p>While some websites and studies claim that clean solar panels can have up to a 25% difference in power output, others are posting numbers as low as 3%.<br></p>
				<p>The truth of the matter is that solar panels will have varying amounts of permanent dirt and grime based on your location. Sanpete Valley has moderate amounts of precipitation, which does help naturally clean solar panels. However, dirt kicked up by cattle, controlled burns, frequent forest fires, and increased amounts of wildlife population mean that rain oftentimes falls with dirt particles.<br></p>
				<p>A similar example that can be thought of is rain on a car window. At first, the window will look clean as the wet rain rests, but as it evaporates and the sun starts to shine through, leftover dirt particles are exposed.<br></p>
				<p><strong>For the Sanpete area, we estimate a 14-18% increase in solar power output.</strong></p>
