# ClearViewSolarAndWindows

Original Project Date: November 2019

This is a website for a solar panel cleaning company my friend tried to start up: Clear View Solar and Windows. While the company itself didn't continue forward, this website was hosted for quite a while until recently I was asked to take it offline by my friend. This wasn't my first time building a website, I had previously worked on my high school's official website (North Sanpete High School) in 2016, but it was my first time working on a website that the only boss I had was the client. 

This website shows that I have a simple knowledge of HTML and CSS, clean user interfaces, and image compression (something I find that many students don't do). Everything on this site loads up fast, conveys exactly what it needs to, is easy to navigate, and has style.
